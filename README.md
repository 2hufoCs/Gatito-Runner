# Gatito-Runner
My first mobile game ever, based on a plush that I own : Gatito!! It's also the first time that I make a game in 3D, so I'm completely out of my comfort zone there.
It's an endless runner, where you need to dodge obtacles left and right along the way. I added 2 twists to it: on the one hand, the player gets larger as they go in the game, making it harder to dodge obstacles;
and on the other hand, they can rotate 90 degrees along the forward axis to take much place vertically instead of horizontally (from a row to a column).
So it's not just about dodging left and right, sometimes you'll have to actually use your brain to survive.

If you want to know what tasks need to be done, take a look at the issues - though most of them are just new features waiting to be added
I don't really have a deadline for this project, but I hope I can finish it before the start of 2024, because I have a ton of other things I want to do too!
Still, I think I won't have a super fast pace for this since it's neither for a game jam nor for anything really, only reason I do this is to try out some new things and have fun (mustn't get too obsessed abt it lol)
